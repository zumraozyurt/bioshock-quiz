    <p>You share traits with Sander Cohen, Rapture's most infamous artist. Like Cohen, you're creative, passionate, and unafraid to express yourself in bold, unconventional ways. You see the world differently than most, and you're not afraid to make others uncomfortable with your vision.</p>
    
    <p>Cohen was a celebrated artist in Rapture who became increasingly unstable as the city descended into chaos. His artistic vision became more extreme, leading to violent and disturbing performances. While his methods were extreme, his dedication to his art was absolute.</p>
    
    <h3>Your Key Traits:</h3>
    <div class="traits">
      <div class="trait">Creative</div>
      <div class="trait">Passionate</div>
      <div class="trait">Unconventional</div>
      <div class="trait">Expressive</div>
      <div class="trait">Intense</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Your artistic spirit is a gift, but remember that true art connects rather than alienates. While Cohen's story shows the dangers of artistic obsession, it also reminds us of the power of creative expression.</p>
