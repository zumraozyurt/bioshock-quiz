    <p>Your results match with Atlas, the charismatic leader of Rapture's rebellion. Like Atlas, you're a natural leader
      who inspires others to follow you. You have a strong sense of justice and a willingness to fight for what you
      believe in, even against overwhelming odds.</p>

    <p>Atlas positioned himself as the voice of the common people against Andrew Ryan's elitist rule. His ability to
      rally the oppressed citizens of Rapture showed his understanding of human nature and his skill at motivation.
      While his true nature was later revealed, his initial message of equality and freedom resonated with many.</p>

    <h3>Your Key Traits:</h3>
    <div class="traits">
      <div class="trait">Charismatic</div>
      <div class="trait">Passionate</div>
      <div class="trait">Persuasive</div>
      <div class="trait">Courageous</div>
      <div class="trait">Strategic</div>
    </div>

    <p>Your ability to inspire others is a gift, but remember that true leadership requires honesty and integrity. The
      story of Atlas reminds us that even the most noble-seeming causes can hide darker truths.</p>
