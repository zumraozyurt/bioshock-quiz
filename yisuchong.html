    <p>You share traits with Yi Suchong, the brilliant but ethically questionable scientist who helped develop Rapture's genetic technologies. Like Suchong, you're intensely curious, willing to push boundaries in pursuit of knowledge, and perhaps a bit too focused on results over morality.</p>
    
    <p>Suchong was instrumental in developing the Plasmid system and other genetic modifications that made Rapture's society possible. His work was groundbreaking but often cruel, showing little regard for ethical constraints. While his scientific achievements were impressive, his lack of compassion ultimately led to his downfall.</p>
    
    <h3>Your Key Traits:</h3>
    <div class="traits">
      <div class="trait">Brilliant</div>
      <div class="trait">Curious</div>
      <div class="trait">Ambitious</div>
      <div class="trait">Unconventional</div>
      <div class="trait">Results-driven</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Your scientific curiosity is a strength, but remember that knowledge without wisdom can be dangerous. Suchong's story reminds us that ethical considerations must accompany scientific progress.</p>
