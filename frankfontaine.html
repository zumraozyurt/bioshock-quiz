    <p>You share traits with Frank Fontaine, the ruthless and manipulative crime boss of Rapture. Like Fontaine, you're pragmatic, resourceful, and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve your goals. You understand that in a world of competing interests, sometimes you have to play dirty to come out on top.</p>
    
    <p>Fontaine came to Rapture as a smuggler and built a criminal empire by exploiting gaps in Ryan's system. His ability to manipulate people and situations was unmatched, and his rivalry with Andrew Ryan ultimately led to Rapture's downfall. While his methods were questionable, his understanding of human nature was keen.</p>

    <p>Your ability to read people and situations is a powerful tool, but be careful not to let short-term gains blind you to long-term consequences. Fontaine's story shows that even the most cunning plans can unravel when pushed too far.</p>
