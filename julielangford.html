    <p>Your results align with Julie Langford, Rapture's brilliant botanist who maintained the city's oxygen supply.
      Like Langford, you're intelligent, compassionate, and deeply connected to the natural world. You understand the
      importance of balance and the interconnectedness of all things.</p>

    <p>Langford was responsible for creating Rapture's gardens and maintaining its oxygen supply through plant life.
      Unlike many of Rapture's residents, she maintained her humanity and compassion even as the city descended into
      chaos. Her work was essential to the city's survival, showing that even in an artificial environment, nature
      remains vital.</p>

      <div class="trait">Essential</div>

    <p>Your connection to nature and people is a gift in an increasingly artificial world. Langford's story reminds us
      that even in the most technologically advanced environments, we must maintain our connection to the natural world
      and to each other.</p>
